# Advanced Server Requests, Deployment, and Postman

## More Server Requests

- POST -> add data to a DB
  - POST requests come with a body
  - we can get the body with req.body, BUT we need to run app.use(express.json()) before we try to extract the body

## Deployment - process of making your website available on the internet

- Render - one website that allows us to use their servers to make our website live

## Postman - app that allows us to make mock requests to our server
